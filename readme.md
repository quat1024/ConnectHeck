Connect Heck
============

Yeah it's a crappy connect 4 game in famed game programming language, 
MATLAB. It's for a school project. Don't judge.

### Features

* Connect 4 against a AI or an opponent in meatspace.
    * The AI is not very good.
        * No really it sucks.
* ASCII art output to console, and graphical output to figure 1.
* ~~Win detection~~ (not yet.)
* Loss.jpg detection - lose when the board completely fills up.

### Usage

Idk open it and run `connectHeck` in the console. Things will happen.
